## Description

### What is Quizzical?

Is a 5 question general knowledge quiz. The questions are generated by Open Trivia Database.

### Technologies used

I have used React for this project:

- I was able to create reusable components for each Q&A and for the homepage
- I could manage and track the state for each stage of the quiz.
- I could use useEffect so code would run based on dependencies

## Implementations for future

- Could enable the ability for a user to choose which type of Quiz they would like to do
- Also could let user to choose how many questions they would like in their quiz
